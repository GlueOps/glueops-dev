# Creating your AWS Account for the GlueOps Platform

To have the GlueOps Platform you need a single AWS account that will be dedicated to the deployment. We recommend creating an AWS sub account, also known as a member account. This requires you setup an AWS Organization which will own all your accounts. By using an AWS Organization you can easily create dozens of AWS sub accounts. We won't go into great detail on how to do this as this is very AWS specific but if you need help just reach out to the GlueOps team and we can provide you with additional guidance for your use case.


:::info
For each cluster you deploy with the GlueOps platform, you must provide a separate AWS account.
:::

Follow the step-by-step guide below to:
- Verify your AWS accounts and increase service quotas
- Create an AWS IAM user


## Verifications and Service Quotas

Depending on your cluster size the GlueOps Platform will need at least 64 vCPU's. To help make it easier to get service quotas we recommend verifying your accounts immediately after account creation. These vCPU's (roughly 16) will be used to deploy the GlueOps Platform Control Plane and the remainder will be used for either your own applications or to provide temporary capacity for security fixes and upgrades.

### Phone verification

1. Login to your AWS Sub/member account and open a [Support Case](http://aws.amazon.com/support).
2. Choose **Account and Billing Support.**
3. For **Type**, select **Account.**
4. For **Category**, select **Activation.**
5. In the **Case description** section, provide a date and time when you can be reached.
6. In the **Contact options section**, select **Chat** for **Contact methods**
7. Choose **Submit.**

### Payment Verification (Setting a default payment method)

1. Login to your AWS Sub/member account
2. Follow the directions as outlined on the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-payment-method.html#manage-designate-default)
   
:::info
Adding the default should have no direct impact on any consolidated Organizational Billing that you may have setup. Since this is a sub account all your bills should still aggregate to the root account. So if you have invoice billing, this should have no impact to that. However, it's always best to check with your AWS account representative on your particular situation.

### Service Quotas

1. Login to the AWS Sub/member account
2. Ensure you are in the region that you want the cluster deployed in.
3. For each quota listed below, follow the steps outlined on the [AWS site to request a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html)

Quotas to increase:

|  Quota name | Minimum Required  |
|---|---|
| Running On-Demand Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) instances  | 32 vCPU |


:::info
The more applications you have the large these numbers may need to be. Please consult with the GlueOps team for your specific use case.

## Creating an AWS IAM User and Credentials

### Creating an AWS IAM User
1. Login to the AWS Sub/member account
2. Create an IAM user, we recommend naming it `captain-deployment-svc-account` and assign it the Policy named `AdministratorAccess`.
3. Copy the full ARN for the user and securely store it.

:::info
If you need help creating a user, please contact the GlueOps team or reference the AWS Documentation here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console
:::

### Creating AWS IAM User Credentials

1. Create Security Credentials for the IAM user you just created and securely save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
   
:::info
If you need help creating credentials, please contact the GlueOps team or reference the AWS Documentation here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html
:::

## Retrieving values

By completing the above steps, you should have verified your AWS accounts and obtained the following values:
- [IAM User ARN](#creating-an-AWS-iam-user-and-credentials)
- [IAM User Credentials](#creating-aws-iam-user-credentials)

These values will be required by the GlueOps team before they can deploy your cluster. Please use a temporary sharing passsword service like [Doppler](https://share.doppler.com/) or [OneTimeSecret](https://onetimesecret.com/) to share it with GlueOps.
