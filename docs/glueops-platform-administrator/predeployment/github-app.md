# Creating your GitHub App

The GlueOps Platform requires you install a GitHub App so that the following services can be provided:

* Deployment of Tenant Applications via a [deployment-configurations](https://github.com/GlueOps/deployment-configurations) repository
* Pull Request comments, generated by the [pull-request-bot](https://github.com/GlueOps/pull-request-bot), to display helpful links associated with preview environments.

To enable GlueOps access to your GitHub organization, you will need to do the following:

- [Creating your GitHub App](#creating-your-github-app)
  - [Create the GitHub App ID](#create-the-github-app-id)
  - [Generate the private key](#generate-the-private-key)
  - [Add Display logo (Optional)](#add-display-logo-optional)
  - [Get Installation ID](#get-installation-id)
  - [Retrieving values](#retrieving-values)

:::info
For each cluster you deploy with the GlueOps platform, create a separate GitHub app as directed below.
:::

Follow the step-by-step guide below to obtain these values:

- GitHub App ID
- Github App Installation ID
- Github App Private Key

## Create the GitHub App ID

To create the GitHub App, follow these steps:

1. On your Github Organization page, go to the **Settings > Developer settings** and click on **GitHub Apps**.

2. Click on **New GitHub App** button.

1. **GitHub App name**: Enter a name for your GitHub app. This will get used as the username for all comments in your Pull Requests and it must be globally unique across all of GitHub. If your **captain domain** is `nonprod.antoniostacos.onglueops.com`, and since it is over the 34 character limit we would recommend calling it: `np - antoniostacos.onglueops.com` where `np` is shorthand for `nonprod`


   - **Homepage URL**: Specify the URL for the GitHub App's homepage. We suggest using `https://glueops.dev`for consistency.

1. Deselect Active as Webhooks are not currently required by the GitHub App.

2. Set the following repository permissions to the GitHub App
   - **Permissions**: Grant the following repository permissions to the GitHub App:
     - `Contents`: Read and write
     - `Discussions`: Read and write
     - `Issues`: Read and write
     - `Metadata`: Read-only (mandatory)
     - `Pull requests`: Read and write

   - **Where can this GitHub App be installed?**: Select "Only on this account." This limits the GitHub App to your organization.

3. Click on **Create GitHub App** to create the GitHub App with the provided configuration.

4. After creating the GitHub App, you will be provided with an **App ID**.

## Generate the private key

To generate the private key for your GitHub App, follow these steps:

- On the GitHub App's homepage, scroll **down** to **Private keys** section

- Click on **Generate a private key**. This will download a private key file.

## Add Display logo (Optional)
Adding logo to your GitHub App ensures that when our bot comments it'll use the image for easy identification. To add the logo:

- Save and download the [GlueOps logo image](https://cdn.glueops.dev/logos/logo.png)

- On the GitHub App's homepage, locate the **Display Information** section and click on **Upload logo**

Once uploaded, this is the final outcome

:::info
You can also upload your own custom image if desired.

## Get Installation ID

To complete the GitHub App setup, you need to install the GitHub App in your organization. 

- In the left side of the GitHub App's homepage, click on **Install App**

- Choose an account to install your GitHub App

- Confirm the installation by following the on-screen prompts.

- This ID can be retrieved from the URL of the App installation homepage

<img width="1032" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-28 at 01 19 29" src="https://cdn.glueops.dev/doc-assets/v1/docs/v1/github-app-installed.png"/>

:::info
From the URL `https://github.com/organizations/antoniostacos/settings/installations/40423720` the GitHub App Installation ID would be `40423720`. Save this Installation ID so that you can provide it to GlueOps.
:::

## Retrieving values

By completing the above steps, you should have obtained the following values from the GitHub App:

- [Creating your GitHub App](#creating-your-github-app)
  - [Create the GitHub App ID](#create-the-github-app-id)
  - [Generate the private key](#generate-the-private-key)
  - [Add Display logo (Optional)](#add-display-logo-optional)
  - [Get Installation ID](#get-installation-id)
  - [Retrieving values](#retrieving-values)

These values will be required by the GlueOps team before they can deploy your cluster. Please use a temporary sharing passsword service like [Doppler](https://share.doppler.com/) or [OneTimeSecret](https://onetimesecret.com/) to share it with GlueOps.
