# GlueOps Captain Domains

Your **captain domain** is the base domain for your GlueOps cluster. Platform services like ArgoCD and Grafana are all accessible under it, and it serves as the default base domain for application routing.

:::info
The captain domain is automatically provided by GlueOps as part of its service.

Let's break down the components of a GlueOps captain domain using an example:

```
<cluster>.<tenant>.onglueops.<tld>
```

For example: <CaptainDomain />

The domain consists of the following parts:

1. **Cluster Identifier (<code><CaptainDomainPart segment="cluster" /></code>):** Identifies which cluster this domain belongs to. Organizations typically run separate clusters per environment — for example, `nonprod` and `prod`.

2. **Tenant Key (<code><CaptainDomainPart segment="tenant" /></code>):** Your organization's identifier on the GlueOps platform. This remains the same across all of your clusters.

3. **Core Domain (<code><CaptainDomainPart segment="tld" /></code>):** The base domain for GlueOps tenant services.

### Application Routing

By default, applications deployed to the cluster use hostnames under <code>apps.<CaptainDomain /></code>. For example, an app called `api` could be reachable at <code>api.apps.<CaptainDomain /></code>. The exact hostname is defined in each app's routing configuration (IngressRoute or Ingress), so you have full control — including the option to use your own custom domains entirely.
